### Background

I recently had the privilege of virtually presenting to supply chain and operations research scholars at a conference held at the [Rukmini Devi Institute of Advanced Studies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdiasrohini/), Delhi, India. This newsletter is aimed at supply chain enthusiasts from the industry and academia who are looking to address challenging and interesting India-centric problems.

### Introduction![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQFSV9QJGiFDPQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1704227152877?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=bjtaPUg0jWcFUStE11O8q_ryM7N4ILxg1uHtrtZyU2w)

65% of India's population is in rural areas and the supply chain problems there are often novel and require non-traditional supply chain solutions.

Supply chain risk management (SCRM) has become increasingly important as global supply chains face growing threats from natural disasters, cyber-attacks, pandemics, and other disruptions. As a rapidly growing economy with complex supply chains, India faces unique SCRM challenges that warrant further research. In this presentation, I outline key SCRM research topics and methodologies that may be of interest to Indian scholars.

### Topics of Interest

Several promising SCRM research areas in the Indian context include:

India has a developing infrastructure that provides interesting opportunities for cost optimization and improving efficiencies.



1. Balancing logistics modal mix and cost efficiency. India's unbalanced reliance on road transport creates inefficiencies. Research could examine the optimal modal mix.
2. Issues facing MSMEs. Micro, small, and medium enterprises lack credit, infrastructure, and skilled labor. Studies on improving MSME supply chain resilience are needed.
3. Mitigating drought/monsoon disruptions in agricultural supply chains. India's crops face serious seasonal threats. Research can identify risk mitigation strategies.
4. Improving rural supply chains. With 65% of India's population in rural areas, studies on last-mile delivery, reverse logistics, digital platforms, and sustainability in rural supply chains can have a major impact.

### Research Methodologies

Indian scholars can utilize both qualitative and quantitative techniques for robust SCRM research:

* Case studies of supply chain disruptions and successful risk mitigation strategies in Indian firms.
* Surveys of MSMEs and agricultural producers to identify challenges.
* Data analytics to model optimal logistics infrastructure investment and supply chain modal mix.
* Field experiments on digital platforms and sustainability initiatives in rural supply chains.
* Simulation models to test disruption response strategies.

### Conclusion

SCRM research has immense potential for a positive impact in India. This research can address unique risks in Indian supply chains, inform training programs, and catalyze the development of resilient and responsible supply chains. I encourage Indian scholars to pioneer innovative SCRM research leveraging India's diverse economic landscape. Please reach out for collaboration opportunities in this exciting field.
