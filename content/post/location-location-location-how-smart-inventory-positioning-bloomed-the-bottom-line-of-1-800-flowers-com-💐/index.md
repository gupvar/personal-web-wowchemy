We all know the real estate mantra: location, location, location. But did you know it applies to your inventory, too? Strategic inventory positioning can differentiate between blossoming profits and wilting margins for e-commerce businesses, especially those dealing with *perishable goods* or *time-sensitive* deliveries.

## What is Inventory Positioning?

Simply put, it's the art and science of distributing your inventory across your network to ensure the right products are in the right place at the right time to meet customer demand. This involves:

1. **Decentralized Warehousing:** Instead of relying on a single, massive warehouse, strategically place smaller fulfillment centers closer to your customer base. Think **hub and spoke** transportation network model.
2. **Demand Forecasting:** Use historical sales data, seasonal trends, and external factors like weather patterns to predict future demand in different regions.
3. **Technology Integration:** Leverage inventory management software and predictive analytics tools to optimize stock levels and automate replenishment decisions.
