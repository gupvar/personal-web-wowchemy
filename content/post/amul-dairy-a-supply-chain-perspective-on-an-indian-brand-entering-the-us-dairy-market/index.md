### Why Amul, Why Now?

* **Established Expertise:** Amul's reputation for high-quality dairy products, built on a robust cooperative model, provides a strong foundation for its US venture. ($55 billion turnover in FY 2022-23 💰)
* **Immense Indian Diaspora:** The US boasts a large Indian diaspora exceeding 4 million strong! 👨👩👧👦 This significant consumer segment yearns for authentic Indian dairy products, and Amul is here to deliver that taste of home.
* **Shifting Dynamics:** The rise of Indian brands expanding globally highlights the changing landscape of international trade. Amul's foray into the US exemplifies this trend. 📈

### Which Products?

Amul is specifically launching its fresh milk range in the US. Here's the breakdown of the products:

* **Amul Gold:** Full-fat milk containing 6% milk fat.

These milk varieties will be available in packs of one gallon (3.8 liters) and half a gallon (1.9 liters).

### Pros and Cons for US Dairy Supply Chains

* **Increased Competition:** Amul's presence could intensify competition for existing players in the US dairy market, valued at a whopping $60 billion, potentially affecting pricing and consumer choices. 🥛 This could lead to more competitive prices and a wider variety of options for consumers.
* **Diversified Supply:** Amul's unique products and established supply chain could bring more variety and alternative sourcing options to the US market. This could benefit both consumers and producers by creating a more dynamic market.

Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/parle-products-pvt.-ltd/) (biscuits), have successfully established themselves in the US market, paving the way for greater Indian food exports.
