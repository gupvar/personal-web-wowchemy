In today's dynamic and complex global landscape, #supplychainvisibility has become more critical than ever. 🌍 For businesses aiming to thrive, the ability to track and manage every node of their supply chain is paramount. Let's delve into why this is essential and how industry giants like [General Motors](https://www.linkedin.com/company/general-motors/) are setting the pace. 🔍💡

### Introduction: The Imperative of Supply Chain Visibility 📊

In an era where disruptions are the norm, achieving end-to-end supply chain visibility is no longer a luxury but a necessity. 🌐 From raw materials to the final product, understanding the journey of goods can make or break a business. This visibility is powered by advanced technologies such as digital twins, which create virtual replicas of physical supply chains, allowing for real-time monitoring and predictive insights. 🛰️
